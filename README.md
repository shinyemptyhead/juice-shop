OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure web application written
entirely in JavaScript which encompasses the entire range of
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten) and other
severe security flaws.

For a detailed introduction, full list of features and architecture
overview please visit the official project page:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project>

## Setup

### Deploy on Heroku (free ($0/month) dyno)

1. Click the button below and follow the instructions

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> This is the quickest way to get a running instance of Juice Shop! If
> you have forked this repository, the deploy button will automatically
> pick up your fork for deployment! As long as you do not perform any
> DDoS attacks you are free to use any tools or scripts to hack your
> Juice Shop instance on Heroku!

### From Sources

1. Install [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop.git` (or
   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you
   change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

### Docker Container [![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop/) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop/) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Run `docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop`
3. Run `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop`
4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000> (on macOS and Windows browse to
   <http://192.168.99.100:3000> if you are using docker-machine instead
   of the native docker installation)

> If you want to run Juice Shop on a Raspberry Pi 3, there is an
> unofficial Docker image available at
> <https://hub.docker.com/r/arclight/juice-shop_arm> which is based on
> `resin/rpi-raspbian` and maintained by
> [@battletux](https://github.com/battletux).

#### Even easier: Run Docker Container from Docker Toolbox (Kitematic)

1. Install and launch
   [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox)
2. Search for `juice-shop` and click _Create_ to download image and run
   container
3. Click on the _Open_ icon next to _Web Preview_ to browse to OWASP
   Juice Shop

### Packaged Distributions [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bkimminich/juice-shop/total.svg)](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest) [![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/juice-shop.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/)

1. Install a 64bit [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility) on your
   Windows (or Linux) machine
2. Download `juice-shop-<version>_<node-version>_<os>_x64.zip` (or
   `.tgz`) attached to
   [latest release](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)
3. Unpack and run `npm start` in unpacked folder
4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

> Each packaged distribution includes some binaries for SQLite bound to
> the OS and node.js version which `npm install` was executed on.

### Amazon EC2 Instance

1. Setup an _Amazon Linux AMI_ instance
2. In _Step 3: Configure Instance Details_ unfold _Advanced Details_ and
   copy the script below into _User Data_
3. In _Step 6: Configure Security Group_ add a _Rule_ that opens port 80
   for HTTP
4. Launch instance
5. Browse to your instance's public DNS

```
#!/bin/bash
# Install docker on the instance
yum update -y
yum install -y docker
# start docker and make sure we don't do anything until it's started
service docker start
chkconfig docker on
# set up the instance so that Juice Shop will run on startup
chmod a+w /etc/rc.d/rc.local
sudo echo "docker run -d -p 80:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
chmod a-w /etc/rc.d/rc.local
# run Juice Shop now as well
docker run -d -p 80:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop 
```
If you want to run this as a CTF instance you can set the appropriate global variables inside the container by using the -e flag on the docker commands.
> Technically Amazon could view hacking activity on any EC2 instance as
> an attack on their AWS infrastructure! We highly discourage aggressive
> scanning or automated brute force attacks! You have been warned!

### Vagrant

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and
   [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop.git` (or
   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Run `cd vagrant && vagrant up`
4. Browse to [192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10)

> To show the possible impact of
> [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)),
> assume you received and (of course) clicked
> [this inconspicuous phishing link](http://192.168.33.10/#/search?q=%3Cscript%3Evar%20js%20%3Ddocument.createElement%28%22script%22%29;js.type%20%3D%20%22text%2Fjavascript%22;js.src%3D%22http:%2F%2F192.168.33.10%2Fshake.js%22;document.body.appendChild%28js%29;varhash%3Dwindow.location.hash;window.location.hash%3Dhash.substr%280,8%29;%3C%2Fscript%3Eapple)
> and login. Apart from the visual/audible effect, the attacker also
> installed [an input logger](http://192.168.33.10/logger.php) to grab
> credentials! This could easily run on a 3rd party server in real life!
>
> _This feature is only available when running a Vagrant box. A
> recording of the effect is available on Youtube:_

## Node.js version compatibility

OWASP Juice Shop officially supports the following versions of
[node.js](http://nodejs.org) in line as close as possible with the
official [node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS). Docker
images and packaged distributions are offered accordingly:

| node.js | [Docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop)             | [Packaged distributions](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)       |
|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __6.x__ | __`latest`__ (current official release), `snapshot` (preview from `develop` branch) | `juice-shop-<version>_node6_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node6_linux_x64.tgz` |
| 8.x     |                                                                                     | `juice-shop-<version>_node8_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node8_linux_x64.tgz` |

## Preview [![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=juice-shop)](https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com)

Feel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:
<https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com>

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

## Customization

Via a YAML configuration file in `/config`, the OWASP Juice Shop can be
customized in its content and look & feel.

For detailed instructions and examples please refer to
[our _Customization_ documentation](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html).

## CTF-Extension

If you want to run OWASP Juice Shop as a Capture-The-Flag event, we
recommend you set it up along with a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) server
conveniently using the official
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
tool.

For step-by-step instructions and examples please refer to
[the _Hosting a CTF event_ chapter](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html)
of our companion guide ebook.
